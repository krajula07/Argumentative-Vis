          What are placements?
        </p>
        <p>
         Internships/full time opportunities which occur in college are generally called as placements.

        This visualization is basically explaining how work experience is important in placements,Where one chart says that work experience doesn't matter and the other says experience matters.

          Left Chart:
        </p>
        <p>
        Left chart takes number of people irrespective of all attributes and depicts experience doesn't matter
         <div>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Rhetoric device : Anchoring</li>
            <li>Rhetoric Method : Omission and Scaling</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

        <p style="color:red;">
          Right Chart:
        </p>
        <p>
        Right chart takes ratio of people that is the percentage of people in all attributes and depicts experience does matter
        <div>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Rhetoric device : Anchoring</li>
            <li>Rhetoric Method : Omission and Scaling</li>
          </ul>

          What inspired me to take this topic?
        </p>
        <p>
         I took this topic because most of the students at the end of the day looks if he /she can get placed .As an international student I actually thought with my experience can I get placed after masters ,Then I went looking consultancies to ask them does it really matters my experience to get placed after masters in US?
          this dilemma and curiosity which inspired me to take this topic.
        </p>

        <p style="color:red;">
          Why is this controversial?
        </p>
        <p>
         AS I told I went to consultancies to get an answer that is it really important? So they have showed me a visualization  which is like the left side of my visualization which shows that it really doesnt matter if you have work experience or not.Infact it showed that the people with no experience(that is newly grads)
have more opportunities.
</p>
<p>
    But the fact is that they have showed number of people got placed but not with respect to how many people are actually present like percentage  ,ratio which gave me the complete opposite graph as shown in the right figure.
</p>
<p>The data which have shown by the consultancy have taken the partial data and have shown the results which are convincible  for their business and misled the students.
